As far as i can tell, this platform is about 99% completed, the problem is that I have 2 AI's, one for image and one for text, the image AI is generating images, just not in the correct way and same with the text AI. I was hoping you could shed some light on the situation. Basically it is a book generating , AI powered platform and so, the kids book ai, which has to generate 1 image per page, depending on the text depends on the image it creates. but its just generating the same image on every page. The text generating AIis supposed to create a novel from a prompt or an upload, however it keeps just creating a book worth of text "outlining" how its going to create each chapter, instead of actually creating the actual chapter, lol, please help!!!!
